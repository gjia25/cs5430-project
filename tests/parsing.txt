This testing document tests the analyzer's ability to distinguish between 
commands and comments.

********************************************************************************
Test 1: Random Characters
*** analyzer should directly output comments that consist of a collection of
    characters that bear no resemblance to command syntax.
***

-= ]]]]][] || hello world

********************************************************************************
Test 2: Comma Separated Values
*** to parse command, the analyzer breaks each line into comma-separated words. 
    lines with a word count that is not equal to four are comments, 
    and should be directly outputted.
***
// word-count < 4
I, am, cheese!
// word-count > 4
big, bad, wolf, happy, sad
// word-count == 1
Add s1 s345 T
Query s1 s345 T

********************************************************************************
Test 3: Add/Query commands
*** tests if analyzer can identify valid add and query command syntax
***
// Valid command and query: s1 is previously unseen subject,
// o1 is previously unseen file object
Add, s1, o1, R
Query, s1, o1, R
// Invalid command and query: P is not a valid privilege
Add, s1, o1, P
Query, s1, o1, P
// Invalid command and query: requesting T privilege for file object
Add, s1, o1, T
Query, s1, o1, T
// Valid command and query: requesting T privilege, where s2 is previously 
// unseen subject (that is also an object)
Add, s1, s2, T
Query, s1, s2, T
// Valid command and query: requesting T privilege, where s1 is previously 
// seen subject (that is also an object)
Add, s2, s1, T
Query, s2, s1, T
// Invalid command and query: cannot add write priv for subject s2
Add, s1, s2, W
Query, s1, s2, W
// Invalid command and query: cannot add read priv for subject s2
Add, s1, s2, R
Query, s1, s2, R
// Valid command and query: add write priv for previously seen subject s2, and
// previously unseen object o2
Add, s2, o2, W
Query, s2, o2, W
// Valid command and query: add write priv for previously seen subject s2, and
// previously seen object o1
Add, s2, o1, W
Query, s2, o1, W
// Valid command and query: add write priv for previously unseen subject s3, and
// previously seen object o1
Add, s3, o1, W
Query, s3, o1, W
