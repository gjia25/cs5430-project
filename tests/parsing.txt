This testing document tests the analyzer's ability to correctly parse the input
txt and distinguish between commands and comments.

********************************************************************************
Test 1: Incorrect command input line length
*** analyzer should recognize that lines of input that consist of fewer or more
    than 4 comma separated values are comments.
***

// replication of empty lines tests the case where comment length == 0

// Comment: length == 1
81271

// Comment: length < 4
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

// Comment: length > 4
Add, s1, o1, R, P, T

********************************************************************************
Test 2: Correct line length, but incorrect syntax.
*** analyzer should recognize that lines of input that consist of 4 comma
    separated values, but do not follow the syntax specified in the project
    writeup are comments.
***

// Invalid command: privilege field is not one of R, W, T
Add, sw, ow, P
Query, sw, ow, P

// Invalid command: Command type is not one of Add, Query
Jinx, sw, ow, R

// Valid add and query: s1 is previously unseen subject,
// o1 is previously unseen file object
Add, s1, o1, R
Query, s1, o1, R
Query, s1, o1, W

// Valid add and query: requesting T privilege, s1 is previously seen subject,
// s2 is previously unseen object (that is also a subject)
Add, s1, s2, T
Query, s1, s2, T

// Invalid add and query: s1 cannot have read priv for s2 (as s2 is not a
// file)
Add, s1, s2, R
Query, s1, s2, R

// Invalid add and query: s1 cannot have write priv for s2 (as s2 is not a
// file)
Add, s1, s2, W
Query, s1, s2, W

// Invalid add and query: s1 cannot augment its privs with those of o1, as o1
// is a file object and there exists no valid authorization triple (o1, O, p)
Add, s1, o1, T
Query, s1, o1, T

// Invalid add and query: o1 cannot be given privs, as it is a file object and
// not a subject
Add, o1, o2, R
Query, o1, o2, R

********************************************************************************
Test 3: (More) Valid Add/Query commands
*** tests if analyzer can identify valid add and query command syntax
***

// Valid R and W commands

// Valid add and queries: s3 is previously unseen subject,
// o1 is previously seen file object
Add, s3, o1, W
Query, s3, o1, R
Query, s3, o1, W

// Valid add and queries: s1 is previously seen subject,
// o3 is previously unseen file object
Add, s1, o3, R
Query, s1, o3, W
Query, s1, o3, R

// Valid add and queries: s3 is previously seen subject,
// o3 is previously seen file object
Add, s3, o3, R
Query, s3, o3, R
Query, s3, o3, W

// Valid T commands

// Valid add and query: requesting T privilege, s1 and s2 are previously 
// seen objects (that are also subjects)
Add, s2, s1, T
Query, s2, s1, T

// Valid add and query: requesting T privilege, s4 is a previously unseen
// subject, s1 is a previously seen object (that is also a subject)
Add, s4, s1, T
Query, s4, s1, T

// Valid add and query: requesting T privilege, s5 is a previously unseen
// subject, s6 is a previously unseen object (that is also a subject)
Add, s5, s6, T
Query, s5, s6, T

// Valid query: querying after privilege in previously unseen subject and 
// object
Query, s7, s8, T

// Valid query: querying after privilege in previously unseen subject and 
// seen object
Query, s9, s1, T

// Valid query: querying after privilege in previously seen subject and 
// unseen object
Query, s9, s10, T
